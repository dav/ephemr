###Ephemr###

This is a proof of concept for a better way to display photos that are intended to be ephemeral (cf Snapchat).

The intention is to obstruct the ability to make a copy of the displayed image either by taking a screenshot or to even take a photo of the display screen.

Ephemr uses a shifting mask to display only part of the photo at a time, forcing the human brain to reconstruct the various images.

This is a simple demo. The effect could be greatly improved by mask creation which aims to more intelligently obscure the underlying photo via color analysis.
